# 🔧 Enable Discord Bot Intents - REQUIRED FOR COMMANDS

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Your bot is connected but can't read messages!

The bot shows this warning:
```
Privileged message content intent is missing, commands may not work as expected.
```

## 🎯 Quick Fix - Enable Message Content Intent:

### Step 1: Enable in Discord Developer Portal
1. **Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)**
2. **Select your bot application** (ID: 1412836680033107990)
3. **Navigate to "Bot" section** (left sidebar)
4. **Scroll down to "Privileged Gateway Intents"**
5. **Enable "MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT"** ✅
6. **Click "Save Changes"**

### Step 2: Restart the Bot
After enabling the intent in Discord, restart your bot:

```bash
# Stop and restart the bot with new intents
docker-compose restart discord-bot

# Or rebuild completely
docker-compose down
docker-compose up --build -d
```

### Step 3: Test Commands
Once restarted, test these commands in your Discord server:
- `!ping` - Should respond with latency
- `!help` - Should show all available commands

## 🔍 What Each Intent Does:

**MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT** (Required for commands):
- ✅ **ENABLE THIS** - Allows bot to read message content
- ✅ Required for `!ping`, `!help`, and all text commands
- ✅ Required for command processing

**SERVER MEMBERS INTENT** (Optional):
- ❓ **Optional** - Allows bot to see member list and user info
- ❓ Needed for welcome messages with member count
- ❓ Needed for member avatars in embeds

## 🚨 If Commands Still Don't Work:

1. **Check bot permissions in Discord server:**
   - Bot needs "Send Messages" permission
   - Bot needs "Read Message History" permission
   - Try giving bot "Administrator" role temporarily

2. **Verify bot is online:**
   - Bot should show green "Online" status
   - Check with `docker-compose logs discord-bot`

3. **Test in different channel:**
   - Try commands in a different channel
   - Make sure channel isn't restricted

4. **Check command format:**
   - Use `!ping` (with exclamation mark)
   - Commands are case-sensitive

## ✅ Expected Result:

After enabling Message Content Intent and restarting:
- `!ping` should respond: "🏓 Pong! Bot latency: **XX**ms"
- `!help` should show full command list
- Bot logs should show no intent warnings

**The bot is connected to your server - it just needs the Message Content Intent enabled to read and respond to your commands!**
